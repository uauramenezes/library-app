## About
The original objective of this project was mainly to learn how to use a third-party API, specifically the Open Library API, in the search mechanism. But also to practice TypeScript and Bootstrap.

The secondary objective was to turn it into a simple CRUD application with authentication. For that, I made use of MongoDB to save the user's authentication data and favourites books. 

Furthermore, I also used React, Node.js and Express to improve my knowledge of these tools.
